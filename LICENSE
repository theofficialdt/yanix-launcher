Summary

Niko's License v3 (NLv3) maintains a copyleft, open-source approach with specific controls over commercial distribution, particularly for forks. It promotes freedom to use, study, modify, and share software, while allowing derivative works to be commercialized under fair, transparent terms that respect the original author's rights.

    Declared Fork: A Derivative Work clearly identifying itself as a fork or modification of the Original Work, and properly acknowledging the license.

    Authorized Attribution: Either inclusion of this license in the source code or clear mention in the distribution description (e.g., “Licensed by NLv3”).

2. Grant of Rights

2.1 Use, Modify, and Study
You may freely use, modify, and study the Original or Derivative Work for personal, educational, or non-commercial use without limitation.

2.2 Forking and Redistribution
You may create forks or Derivative Works and redistribute them under this license, provided all terms are respected.
3. Commercial Distribution Terms

Only the original copyright holder may commercialize the Original Work.

3.2 Fork Commercialization by Third Parties
You may commercialize a Declared Fork, under the following conditions:

    A 0.87% fee of each sale or monetization amount must be directed to the original author.

    If the total converted fee in the selling region’s currency is lower than the platform's accepted minimum (e.g., <$6), the fee may be rounded up appropriately.

    If the original author does not provide a valid payment method, the platform retains the fee temporarily as fallback compensation.

Commercial forks must include either:

    A copy of this license in the source code (LICENSE.txt or similar), or

    A clear public mention such as “Licensed by NLv3” in the product description.

Only the original author may provide freemium versions (free base + paid features or services).
4. Source Code and Openness

    Derivative Works must remain open source under NLv3.

    Source code must be available upon distribution.

    Clear changelogs must document modifications.
